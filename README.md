## compile.sh

Bash script used to compile PHP on MacOS and Linux platforms. Make sure you have ``make autoconf automake libtool m4 wget getconf gzip bzip2 bison g++ git cmake pkg-config re2c ca-certificates``.

### Recommendations
- If you're going to use the compiled binary only on the machine you're build it on, remove the `-t` option for best performance - this will allow the script to optimize for the current machine rather than a generic one.
- [`ext-gd2`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.image.php) is NOT included unless the `-g` flag is provided, as PocketMine-MP doesn't need it. However, if your plugins need it, don't forget to enable it using `-g`.
- The `-c` and `-l` options can be used to specify cache folders to speed up recompiling if you're recompiling many times (e.g. to improve the script).

### Common pitfalls
- Avoid using the script in directory trees containing spaces. Some libraries don't like trying to be built in directory trees containing spaces, e.g. `/home/user/my folder/pocketmine-mp/` might experience problems.
- Avoid directory trees containing special (non-English) symbols. For example, `D??veloppement` might cause issues.

### Additional notes
#### Mac OSX (native compile)
- Most dependencies can be installed using Homebrew
- You will additionally need `glibtool` (GNU libtool, xcode libtool won't work)

#### Android 64-bit (cross-compile)
- Only aarch64 targets are supported for Android cross-compile.
- The `aarch64-linux-musl` toolchain is required. You can compile and install it using https://github.com/pmmp/musl-cross-make (PMMP fork includes musl-libc patches for DNS resolver config path and increasing stack size limit for LevelDB)

## windows-compile-vs.ps1
